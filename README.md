Agar.io Expose â€” helper script for agar.io modding.
It allows you access to game state (e.g., visible cell positions and names, and much more) inside your mods.

## How to use it?
Just install [`expose.user.js`][raw link] using [Tampermonkey][] (Google Chrome) or [Greasemonkey][] (Firefox).
After then, you will be able to access internal agar's variables using `window.agar` object.
See [project wiki][] for an API reference.
